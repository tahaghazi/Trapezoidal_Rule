# Trapezoidal Rule
Trapezoidal Rule

In Calculus, “Trapezoidal Rule” is one of the important integration rules. The name trapezoidal is because when the area under the curve is evaluated, then the total area is divided into small trapezoids instead of rectangles. This rule is used for approximating the definite integrals where it uses the linear approximations of the functions.
